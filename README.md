# Mark Stamer's Website

This repository contains the source code of my website showcasing my work and professional experience as an iOS Developer. It is build with [Ignite](https://github.com/twostraws/Ignite), a open-source static site builder, which allows to create websites in Swift using a SwiftUI-like syntax. Feel free to take a look around.
